This project is a front-end clone of the Myntra e-commerce website, built using HTML and CSS to replicate its user interface. The goal is to practice and enhance HTML/CSS skills by recreating key components such as the header, navigation menu, product grid, filters, and footer, ensuring responsiveness across various devices. The project involves structuring semantic HTML, styling with CSS to match Myntra's design, and implementing responsive design principles. Additional features like carousels, sticky headers, and animations can be added for a more advanced experience. This clone serves as a hands-on exercise in web development and UI design.
